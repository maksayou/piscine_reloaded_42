# piscine_reloaded_42

No problem, it's Piscine time again!

Libft is a great project to recreate functions and programs created during the Piscine. 

Make sure to include some useful libraries in your Makefile, such as:
- #include <unistd.h>
- #include <stdio.h>
- #include <stdlib.h>
- #include <stdio.h>
- #include <string.h>

By doing this, you will be able to use them without writing them in your function files.

To do so, simply write    << #include "libft.h" >> in all of your *.c files!

To understand what a Makefile is and how it works, I recommend this video

Welcome back and good luck!
